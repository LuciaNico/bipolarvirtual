With this project we aim to:

\- [Consolidate a research consortium]{.underline} to support and externally fund applications for *co-designing module interventions for capacity building to manage risk behaviors in daily life for people with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder*.

\- [Develop a network]{.underline} on risk behavior management in daily life that will provide strategic links with health providers (e.g., NHS), third sector organisations (e.g., Bipolar UK) and other relevant stakeholders.

\- [Develop knowledge exchange and research strategic initiatives]{.underline}, such as development of resources to support current community support activities.
