    "text": "Summary: The Experience of Serious Risk-Taking Behaviors in Bipolar Disorders: Exploring the Potential for Co-Design Resources within Community Support Groups.\nGuillermo Perez Algorta, David Dinham & Emmanuel Tsekleves\nBipolar Disorder (BD) impacts millions globally, causing intense mood swings and risky behaviors. People with BD often engage in actions like substance misuse and financial recklessness, leading to prolonged mood issues and even life-threatening situations. However, existing interventions mainly focus on mood regulation, leaving a gap in directly addressing these risky behaviors.\nOur proposal offers a fresh perspective by introducing co-design to create resources for managing these behaviors. Inspired by Fuzzy Trace Theory (FTT), we shift the focus from detailed reasoning to a simpler, more qualitative approach. The key idea is to encourage individuals to grasp the essential meaning of daily situations involving risk and connect it with their personal values.\nIn practical terms, this means training individuals to use “gist” reasoning, to navigate situations involving risk. Our approach is guided by four themes drawn from real-life experiences of individuals with BD: “True Self and Risk,” “Empowerment, Sense of Control and Self-Compassion,” “Intolerance of Uncertainty in the Context of Risk,” and “Systemic-Relational Aspects Relevant to Risk.”\nCommunity Support Groups (CSG) could play a crucial role in implementing these activities. These groups, rooted in asset-based approaches, empower participants to thrive despite BD challenges. They offer inclusive opportunities for diverse learning, communication, and shared experiences.\nThe co-design approach is essential for developing interventions. By incorporating lived expertise from individuals with BD alongside clinical and research perspectives, we aim to create solutions that resonate with those they intend to benefit.\nOur “phygital” space, inspired by community allotments and gardens, will combine physical and online environments, fostering collaboration, inquiry, and knowledge exchange. This approach will allow us to address complex health issues related to BD effectively.\nIn essence, our proposal seeks to transform the narrative around risky behaviors in BD. By emphasizing simple understanding of risk, integrating personal values, and leveraging community support groups, we aim to empower individuals to actively manage their behaviors. The co-design methodology ensures interventions are co-created with the very individuals they aim to benefit, reflecting a commitment to holistic and impactful solutions for those navigating the complexities of BD.\n\nClick here to access White Paper full version."

The second one (Yaghmaei et al., 2023) addresses the issue with a focus on the experience of families of people with bipolar disorder, the “unheard voices”.\nRegardless of the study participants’ cultural differences, both studies complement each other, opening a window to appreciate the nuances and complexities of the topic of sexuality in the context of bipolar disorders.\nIt is clear that this is an area screaming for concrete resources to improve prevention and reduce serious risks associated with these serious behaviours."

Just like the central pillar supports the building, an individual’s self-awareness and deeply held values can provide stability during manic episodes, preventing total collapse into harmful behaviours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a minute to reflect on thsee questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd question 1 here?\nAdd question 2 here?\nAdd question 3 here?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoint Construction without Nails = Healthy Relationships\n\n\n\n\nAncient Buildings: The joints in ancient wooden buildings are designed to be flexible, allowing the building to move and sway without snapping or breaking. This flexibility is crucial for absorbing seismic shocks.\nHuman Experience: Healthy, flexible relationships that allow for emotional movement and adaptation without rigid expectations can absorb the shocks of mood episodes. Supportive relationships can bend, adjust, and accommodate mood fluctuations without breaking under the strain. These relationships, like family or close friends, provide support while giving space for individual emotional experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake one minute to reflect on these questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1\nQuestion 2\nQuestion 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti-Tiered Roofs = Social Support, Layered Resources and Crisis Prevention\n\n\n\n\nAncient Buildings: The multi-tiered roofs in pagodas help distribute the forces of an earthquake, acting like shock absorbers that slow down and spread out the shaking. Human Experience: Layered social support systems—including family, friends, healthcare professionals, and community resources—act like the multiple layers of a roof. Each layer provides an additional buffer, spreading out emotional shocks and offering safety nets that can slow down the escalation of risky behaviours. These layers work together to ensure that no single source of support bears the entire load.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymmetrical and Simple Design = Balanced Lifestyle\n\n\n\n\nAncient Buildings: The symmetrical and simple designs of ancient buildings help distribute stress evenly during an earthquake, reducing the concentration of forces on any one part of the structure. Human Experience: A balanced lifestyle—including time for self-care, work, social engagement, and rest—helps distribute the “emotional load” of life evenly, preventing any one aspect of life from becoming too overwhelming. This balance ensures that even during stressful periods, a person isn’t overwhelmed by any single area (e.g., work stress or relationship issues), reducing the risk of extreme reactions during mood episodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlexible Wooden Structure = Emotional Adaptability and Coping Skills\n\n\n\n\nAncient Buildings: The flexible wooden structure of Japanese buildings allows them to bend and absorb energy without breaking under stress. Human Experience: Emotional adaptability and well-developed coping skills (e.g., mindfulness, emotional regulation techniques, therapy) function in a similar way, allowing a person to “bend” with emotional highs and lows without breaking down. These coping skills help an individual manage mood swings in a healthy way, reducing the impact of manic episodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase Isolation (Floating Foundations) = Grounded Daily Routine and Stability\n\n\n\n\nAncient Buildings: In some ancient structures, the foundation stones allow the building to “float” above the ground, moving slightly with the earthquake rather than fighting against it. This helps absorb the shock and prevent the structure from crumbling. Human Experience: A grounded daily routine—including regular sleep, consistent medication, and structured activities—acts like a floating foundation. It gives individuals a stable base from which they can handle mood swings. Routine can absorb the shocks of mood changes and prevent escalation, offering a predictable structure that remains steady even during emotional upheavals."

    "text": "Slide 1\nFor resources about creating slides in Quarto see: https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/\n\n\nIntroduction\nPeople with Bipolar Disorder (BD) face significant risks of engaging in unpredictable, time-limited, yet devastating behaviours such as substance abuse, hypersexuality, relationship breakdown, and financial recklessness.\nThese behaviours often mirror the sudden and powerful impact of natural disasters like earthquakes, leaving individuals and their families dealing with severe consequences, such as legal issues, mental health crises, and strained relationships.\n\n\nProblem Statement\nDespite their clinical significance, risk-taking behaviours in BD remain under-addressed in current therapeutic models, and existing resources fail to provide individuals with tailored support for managing these behaviours.\nCurrent Interventions: - Focus mainly on mood regulation - Gap: Directly addressing risky behaviours (bipolar2020?)\n\n\nOverarching Goal\nWe are embarked on developing a personalised recovery and resilience kit, co-designed with stakeholders and guided by the metaphor of earthquake-resistant Japanese pagoda architecture.\nJust as a pagoda withstands earthquakes through its flexible yet strong design, this kit will offer adaptable, layered support to enhance recovery and resilience in individuals with BD.\n[Edit to create other slides…]This project aims to develop and implement a personalised recovery and resilience kit for individuals with BD [and their carers], offering tailored support to manage serious risk-taking behaviours. By following the pagoda metaphor—with flexible, layered support that mirrors the resilience of earthquake-resistant architecture—this kit provides an innovative approach to BD management.\nThrough careful co-design, and pilot testing, we plan to set up the basic structure to develop future projects to evaluate integration into existing care pathways. This project aligns with implementation science principles, ensuring that the kit is practical, accessible, and potentially scalable across diverse healthcare settings.\n\n\nThe Metaphor of the Pagoda\nThe metaphor of a traditional Japanese pagoda provides a structural and philosophical framework for developing a personalised kit to help individuals with BD.\nPagodas are built to withstand earthquakes through a combination of flexibility and strength, specifically using features like the shinbashira (a central pillar) and interlocking wooden joints. These architectural elements are designed to absorb shocks and maintain stability during crises—an ideal metaphor for the personalised kit that we propose for individuals with BD.\n[develop separate slides] Each part of the pagoda offers inspiration for a different aspect of the kit:\n\nShinbashira (Core Self-Narratives): The central pillar represents an individual’s sense of self (identity, values). For individuals with BD, maintaining a strong personal narrative can serve as an anchor during mood swings. The kit would include exercises like journaling, self-affirmations, and tools to help individuals reconnect with their core identity during mood episodes. [Need adaptation to reflect the complexity: see @potter2013 and @carls-diamante2023 as examples)\nInterlocking Joints (Social Support Networks): The joints of a pagoda allow flexibility while maintaining the structure’s integrity. These joints can be likened to the personal and social networks that help individuals with BD manage their condition. The survival kit would include resources for strengthening relationships, building effective communication strategies, and accessing social support during times of crisis.\nTiers (Coping Strategies): The multiple levels of a pagoda represent different coping strategies that work together to ensure resilience. For BD, this could mean incorporating mindfulness exercises, grounding techniques, and emotional regulation practices tailored to various levels of mood disturbance (mild, moderate, severe).\nRoof (Protection and Boundaries): The roof of the pagoda shields the structure, much like personal boundaries protect emotional well-being. The kit would include tools for setting personal boundaries, managing time effectively, and creating a safe environment that reduces stress and emotional overload.\nFoundation (Physical Well-being): Just as a pagoda’s base provides stability, the foundation of an individual’s well-being is rooted in their physical health. The kit would include resources on managing sleep, diet, exercise, and medication adherence, all of which are crucial for maintaining mental and emotional balance. [eg. Bipolar UK app?]\n\n\n\nCo-Design Approach\nImportance of Co-Design:\n- Incorporate lived expertise of individuals with BD\n- Combine clinical and research perspectives\n- Create resonant solutions with those they aim to benefit\n- Commitment to holistic and impactful solutions\nCo-Designing the Bipolar Disorder Kit\n1. Preparation (Planning the Kit)\nMuch like an earthquake survival kit requires careful planning, the BD kit would be co-designed with the input of individuals living with BD, clinicians, and family members. This collaborative design process will ensure that the resources are relevant, accessible, and tailored to the specific needs of each individual. Workshops will be held to identify the essential personal tools for managing risk behaviours, allowing for a more holistic approach to treatment.\n2. Accessibility (Using the Kit During Episodes)\nIn earthquake-prone areas, survival kits must be easily accessible when disaster strikes. Similarly, for individuals with BD, the survival kit must be easy to access before, during and after mood episodes. This could take the form of a digital toolkit or app that reminds individuals of their coping strategies, core self-narratives, and support networks. Physical reminders, such as notes or cards, could also be included to provide quick access to essential resources during moments of crisis.\n3. Applicability (Implementing the Kit)\nFinally, the kit must be integrated into daily life. This stage focuses on helping individuals implement the tools and resources in the kit regularly, much like practicing emergency drills. Routine check-ins, self-assessment tools, and regular support from clinicians and family members would ensure that the kit remains a practical, living resource that adapts to the changing needs of the individual.\n\n\nRole of Community Support Groups\n- [DD can add content here. eg. http://nsuworks.nova.edu/tqr/vol22/iss1/12, Worrall (2018)]\n- Key role in implementing activities\n- Focus on self-management\n- Asset-based approach\n- Empower participants despite BD challenges\n- Inclusive learning, communication, and shared experiences\n\n\nPhygital Space\n- Inspired by community allotments and gardens\n- Combines physical and online environments\n- Fosters collaboration, inquiry, and knowledge exchange\n\n\nSelf Identity (Shinbashira)\nThis is a summary of two papers with different points of view re identify in BD [think if we want to create some slides around these ideas].\n\nCarls-Diamante’s Taxonomy (2023)- “Know Thyself: Bipolar Disorder and Self-Concept”:\n\n[would these slides be delivered to a research/professional healthcare audience?]\nCarls-Diamante introduces a taxonomy to conceptualise the relationship between bipolar disorder (BD) and self-concept. The taxonomy aims to clarify how individuals with BD might perceive the influence of the condition on their personality, behaviour, and self-concept. The taxonomy identifies four possible relationships between BD and the self, emphasizing that these categories are not fixed and can change over time:\n\nBD contributes to the self: In this view, BD is seen as contributing certain traits to an individual’s self-concept. For instance, certain aspects of creativity, energy, or emotional intensity during manic phases may be attributed to BD and are considered part of the person’s authentic self.\nBD scaffolds the self: Here, BD is thought to shape or scaffold the development of the self. Certain traits or cognitive patterns influenced by BD, such as creativity or ambition, guide the individual’s personal development, although other aspects of the self remain independent of BD.\nBD gradually becomes part of the self: In this relationship, BD increasingly integrates into an individual’s self-concept over time, especially when symptoms are severe or frequent. Individuals may begin to feel that BD and its associated traits are inseparable from their identity.\nBD is not part of the real self: In this case, BD is viewed as something external or separate from the individual’s core identity. The person might view BD as a disorder they manage but not as a fundamental part of who they are.\n\nCarls-Diamante emphasizes that these categories help individuals reflect on how BD affects their self-concept, with the goal of resolving “self-illness ambiguity” (SIA)—the confusion about whether certain behaviours or traits stem from the self or the disorder.\nde Haan’s Response (2023) Haan (2023) - “What Do My Problems Say About Me?”:\nde Haan critiques Carls-Diamante’s taxonomy, offering an alternative view based on an enactive approach to psychiatry. This approach emphasizes sense-making as a dynamic process shaped by interaction with the world, rather than focusing on static categories of self-concept. de Haan presents key points of divergence from Carls-Diamante’s framework:\n\nCriticism of the Essentialist Approach: de Haan argues that Carls-Diamante’s taxonomy assumes an essentialist view of mental disorders, suggesting that BD is something that can be clearly delineated from the self. de Haan proposes instead that the relationship between self and disorder is more fluid and intertwined, and the focus should be on how individuals make sense of their experiences.\nRelational Nature of Self-Knowledge: Contrary to Carls-Diamante’s emphasis on self-reflection to resolve SIA, de Haan posits that knowing oneself is not purely an individual task. Instead, it is a relational and practical process that involves engaging with others, such as family members or therapists. Self-knowledge, de Haan argues, is best understood through social interactions and material practices rather than through introspection alone.\nTwo Types of Self-Illness Ambiguity: de Haan distinguishes between two forms of SIA: experiential SIA (the ambiguity related to interpreting specific experiences, such as “Is this behavior a result of BD or just me?”) and existential SIA (the broader, long-term question of how to live in accordance with one’s values while managing vulnerabilities like BD). She criticizes Carls-Diamante for focusing more on the conceptual side of SIA rather than recognizing these distinctions.\nEnactive Approach to Mental Health: de Haan’s enactive approach suggests that psychiatric problems arise when one’s patterns of sense-making become rigid and inflexible, and the challenge lies in developing more flexible, adaptive ways of interpreting experiences. She argues that Carls-Diamante’s taxonomy may oversimplify the complexity of how BD affects self-concept by focusing too much on categorization.\n\nKey Differences:\n\nFocus on Reflection vs. Interaction: Carls-Diamante emphasizes individual reflection to resolve ambiguity about BD’s role in self-concept, while de Haan insists that self-knowledge is a relational process shaped by interactions with others and cannot be achieved through introspection alone.\nApproach to Self-Illness Ambiguity: Carls-Diamante’s taxonomy aims to help individuals classify how BD fits into their self-concept. In contrast, de Haan focuses on how sense-making can become rigid, and advocates for a more dynamic, relational process to deal with SIA.\nEssentialism vs. Enactivism: Carls-Diamante’s model assumes BD can be somewhat isolated as a contributing or scaffolding factor to the self, while de Haan critiques this, proposing that mental disorders and self-concept are deeply intertwined in a complex, enactive system of meaning-making.\n\n\n\nGoals\nTransforming the Narrative:\n- Emphasize simple understanding of risk\n- [What risks do people with BD face?]\n- Integrate personal values [gist?]\n- Leverage community support groups\n- Empower individuals to manage behaviours\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nHaan, Sanneke de. 2023. “What Do My Problems Say about Me?” Philosophical Explorations 26 (2): 159–64. https://doi.org/10.1080/13869795.2023.2205416."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In life, everyone encounters their own unique set of challenges. It is as if each person is given their own plot of land at birth, where they go through life nurturing their land and working through individual challenges to overcome. For some individuals, their challenges can range from pesky weeds or crop pests, which poses an impactful problem that requires a solution.\nSome individuals were given pieces of land that face an entirely different array of difficulties. Instead of their difficulties being associated with what’s on the land, their challenge may be navigating the parcel of land itself. Their plot of land may be prone to events that are extreme and unpredictable, much like earthquakes. The challenges faced by people with BD are one example of this.\n\nPeople with BD face significant risks of engaging in unpredictable, time-limited, yet devastating behaviours such as substance abuse, hypersexuality, relationship breakdown, self-harm, and financial recklessness, but there are gaps in the types of support provided to individuals with a diagnosis of BD, which focuses primarily on regulating mood. These gaps in support have left other challenges experienced by them, including risk-taking and decision-making, largely unresolved.\nThis is why we are working on the Personalised Recovery and Resilience Kit (PRRK)—a participatory approach inspired by the precision and wisdom of Japanese craftsmanship and the transformative potential of human-AI collaboration. You may find that alternative metaphors fit the structure of the kit, and we hope that you feel free to personalize your individual kit by creating your own personal metaphor, if you wish. However, for the purpose of creating a general outline for this kit, we are using the structurally supportive and sound principles of Japanese craftmanship. Below you will find the kit, where you can click on each section to learn more about the different elements.\n\nThe Kit\n\n Why This Matters The Earthquake Metaphor Crafting Resilience The Master-Apprentice Relationship Breaking Down Complexity Tailoring Solutions: Respect for Individuality Preparedness for Acute Situations Finding Strength in Repair\n\n\n\nWhy This Matters\nBipolar Disorder (BD) is a complex mental health condition that profoundly impacts those living with it, as well as their families and communities. Despite advancements in treatments and technologies, managing BD often requires more than clinical interventions—it demands empathy, lived experience, creativity, and adaptability. These human qualities remain irreplaceable, even in an era of sophisticated technology.\nBy bringing together the lived experiences of individuals with BD, insights from caregivers and mental health professionals, and technological resources, we are crafting a framework that empowers people to navigate their unique journeys with greater confidence and support.\n\n\n\nThe Earthquake Metaphor\nLiving with Bipolar Disorder (BD) can feel like navigating a landscape prone to sudden, unpredictable earthquakes. The highs and lows, like tremors and aftershocks, can disrupt daily life and leave individuals and their support networks striving to find stability. How do we prepare for such uncertainty while fostering resilience and recovery?\nBy using a second metaphor, the PRRK draws inspiration from the earthquake-resistant design of Japanese pagodas—structures that have withstood centuries of seismic activity. These pagodas balance flexibility and strength, using principles like interlocking joints and a central pillar to absorb shocks while maintaining stability.\nIn the context of BD, the pagoda becomes a metaphor for resilience: a framework where each “tier” represents a vital aspect of well-being, from physical and emotional health to social support and coping strategies. Human insights, combined with online resources, help co-create tools that align with individual needs—building a system that adapts to life’s challenges, just as the pagoda adapts to the forces of nature. To access a full description of the pagoda metaphor, click here.\n\n\n\nCrafting Resilience\nResilience isn’t built overnight—it’s an ongoing process of learning, adapting, and growing. In Japanese craftsmanship, principles like kaizen (continuous improvement) and wabi-sabi (acceptance of imperfection) provide timeless wisdom that resonates deeply in mental health care.\nKaizen teaches us to embrace incremental, steady progress rather than seeking perfection all at once. In mental health, this might mean celebrating small wins, like sticking to a daily routine or reaching out for support, as these build a foundation for long-term well-being.\nWabi-sabi, on the other hand, reminds us to find beauty in imperfection and impermanence. It’s about accepting that life, recovery, and even our coping strategies won’t always be flawless—and that’s okay. For someone living with Bipolar Disorder, this might look like embracing setbacks as opportunities for growth and learning.\nFor instance, a participant in our project described their recovery journey as a patchwork quilt: each piece imperfect but contributing to a unique, meaningful whole. This quilt, much like resilience itself, is strengthened over time through care and thoughtful effort.\n\n\n\nThe Master-Apprentice Relationship\nIn craftsmanship, the relationship between master and apprentice is a cornerstone of learning and growth. The master imparts not just skills but also values—patience, precision, and dedication. This same principle plays a pivotal role in mental health care and our PRRK project.\nMentorship fosters collaboration and trust between individuals with BD, caregivers, and mental health professionals. Each brings unique expertise: lived experience, compassionate care, or clinical knowledge. Together, they co-create tools and strategies tailored to individual needs, blending wisdom from every perspective.\nFor example, one participant shared how a peer mentor—a fellow individual with lived experience of BD—helped them through challenging times. By offering practical advice and emotional support, the mentor modelled resilience and self-compassion, inspiring them to approach their own journey with greater confidence.\nMentorship creates a ripple effect, empowering both mentor and mentee while enriching the entire community. It’s this collaborative spirit that drives our co-design approach, ensuring the PRRK reflects real-world challenges and solutions.\n\n\n Breaking Down Complexity\nComplex challenges, like managing Bipolar Disorder (BD), can feel overwhelming. But just as craftsmen approach intricate designs by breaking them into manageable steps, our PRRK adopts a gradual, participatory approach to co-design solutions.\nThis means working collaboratively, step by step, to create tools that are meaningful, practical, and easy to use. Participants—individuals with BD, caregivers, and professionals—contribute insights in stages, ensuring the process is neither rushed nor overwhelming. Each small step builds toward a cohesive framework that reflects the lived realities of managing BD.\nThis step-by-step approach ensures that every voice is heard and that the resulting tools are rooted in real-world needs and experiences.\n\n\n Tailoring Solutions: Respect for Individuality\nNo two journeys with Bipolar Disorder (BD) are the same, which is why the PRRK is designed with respect for individuality at its core. Inspired by craftsmanship, which honours the unique properties of each material, the PRRK tailors its tools to meet the specific needs, strengths, and vulnerabilities of each person.\nGuided by technology, the kit dynamically organises contributions from individuals, caregivers, and professionals into a meaningful, personalised framework. For example, one participant shared how their personalised plan included calming sensory aids for acute distress and journaling prompts to reflect on progress. These tailored strategies helped them feel more in control and supported on their unique journey.\nPersonalisation, powered by human insights and AI, ensures that the PRRK adapts to each individual’s evolving needs. This respect for individuality fosters a sense of ownership and empowerment, leading to better outcomes and greater resilience.\n\n\n\nPreparedness for Acute Situations\nIn moments of acute distress, preparedness is everything. Inspired by the principles of mottainai (efficiency) and waza (mastery through repetition), the PRRK equips individuals with pre-prepared tools designed for quick, effective responses to mental health crises.\nMottainai teaches us to focus on what is essential—using resources purposefully to stabilise a situation without adding unnecessary burden. This translates into simple, efficient interventions like a sensory grounding exercise or a calming mantra that can be quickly accessed when emotions run high.\nMeanwhile, waza emphasises the importance of mastering techniques through repetition so they become second nature. For example, one participant shared how practising paced breathing daily helped them instinctively use it during a moment of extreme anxiety, preventing escalation and restoring a sense of calm.\nThe PRRK incorporates these principles by offering quick-access tools such as breathing exercises, grounding techniques, and sensory aids. These interventions are designed to provide immediate relief while creating space for recovery and reflection.\n\n\n Finding Strength in Repair\nLife’s challenges can leave us feeling broken, but the Japanese art of kintsugi reminds us that repair can lead to something even more beautiful.\nKintsugi, or “repair with gold,” involves mending broken pottery with precious metals, highlighting the cracks rather than hiding them. The result? A unique, resilient piece that tells its story through its scars.\nIn mental health and recovery, kintsugi is a powerful metaphor for finding strength in setbacks. The PRRK embraces this philosophy, encouraging individuals to view challenges not as failures but as opportunities for growth and transformation.\nRecovery isn’t about erasing what’s broken—it’s about embracing the imperfections and emerging stronger, more vibrant, and uniquely you.\n\n\n\n[Section with a paragraph asking for feedback and contact information.]"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Below you will find a visual and written description of the pagoda as a metaphor for mental wellness. We invite you to read through the text and reflect on each component using our guiding questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentral Pillar (Shinbashira) = Core Values and Self-Identity\nAncient Buildings: The central pillar (shinbashira) in pagodas acts as a stabilising “spine,” helping the structure distribute seismic forces and maintain balance.\nHuman Experience: A strong sense of core values, personal identity, or self-understanding can serve as the central “pillar” in a person’s life, grounding them even when mood fluctuations shake their emotional landscape. Just like the central pillar supports the building, an individual’s self-awareness and deeply held values can provide stability during manic episodes, preventing total collapse into harmful behaviours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are three core values that are most important to you, and how do they guide your decisions?\nHow has your sense of identity changed or remained the same since transitioning to university?\nWhat challenges have made you question your values or identity, and how have you responded to them?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoint Construction without Nails = Healthy Relationships\nAncient Buildings: The joints in ancient wooden buildings are designed to be flexible, allowing the building to move and sway without snapping or breaking. This flexibility is crucial for absorbing seismic shocks.\nHuman Experience: Healthy, flexible relationships that allow for emotional movement and adaptation without rigid expectations can absorb the shocks of mood episodes. Supportive relationships can bend, adjust, and accommodate mood fluctuations without breaking under the strain. These relationships, like family or close friends, provide support while giving space for individual emotional experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho are the key people in your life who provide support, and how do they help you during challenging times?\nHow do you maintain healthy boundaries in relationships while adapting to new social environments at university?\nWhat strategies can you use to build new supportive connections while keeping existing relationships strong?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti-Tiered Roofs = Social Support, Layered Resources and Crisis Prevention\nAncient Buildings: The multi-tiered roofs in pagodas help distribute the forces of an earthquake, acting like shock absorbers that slow down and spread out the shaking.\nHuman Experience: Layered social support systems—including family, friends, healthcare professionals, and community resources—act like the multiple layers of a roof. Each layer provides an additional buffer, spreading out emotional shocks and offering safety nets that can slow down the escalation of risky behaviours. These layers work together to ensure that no single source of support bears the entire load.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the different layers of support available to you at university (e.g., friends, family, faculty, mental health services), and how do they help you?\nHow comfortable do you feel reaching out for support when needed, and what might make it easier for you?\nWhat proactive steps can you take to strengthen your support network before a crisis occurs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymmetrical and Simple Design = Balanced Lifestyle\nAncient Buildings: The symmetrical and simple designs of ancient buildings help distribute stress evenly during an earthquake, reducing the concentration of forces on any one part of the structure.\nHuman Experience: A balanced lifestyle—including time for self-care, work, social engagement, and rest—helps distribute the “emotional load” of life evenly, preventing any one aspect of life from becoming too overwhelming. This balance ensures that even during stressful periods, a person isn’t overwhelmed by any single area (e.g., work stress or relationship issues), reducing the risk of extreme reactions during mood episodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do you currently distribute your time between academic work, social life, self-care, and relaxation?\nWhat aspects of your routine feel unbalanced, and what small changes could help restore stability?\nIf stress levels were rising, what would be the first area in your life that you would adjust to maintain balance?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlexible Wooden Structure = Emotional Adaptability and Coping Skills\nAncient Buildings: The flexible wooden structure of Japanese buildings allows them to bend and absorb energy without breaking under stress.\nHuman Experience: Emotional adaptability and well-developed coping skills (e.g., mindfulness, emotional regulation techniques, therapy) function in a similar way, allowing a person to “bend” with emotional highs and lows without breaking down. These coping skills help an individual manage mood swings in a healthy way, reducing the impact of manic episodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about a recent challenge you faced—how did you adapt, and what coping strategies helped you?\nWhat are your go-to strategies for managing stress, and how well do they work for you?\nHow can you develop greater emotional flexibility to handle unexpected changes more effectively?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase Isolation (Floating Foundations) = Grounded Daily Routine and Stability\nAncient Buildings: In some ancient structures, the foundation stones allow the building to “float” above the ground, moving slightly with the earthquake rather than fighting against it. This helps absorb the shock and prevent the structure from crumbling.\nHuman Experience: A grounded daily routine—including regular sleep, consistent medication, and structured activities—acts like a floating foundation. It gives individuals a stable base from which they can handle mood swings. Routine can absorb the shocks of mood changes and prevent escalation, offering a predictable structure that remains steady even during emotional upheavals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to Consider\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat routines or habits provide you with a sense of stability in your daily life?\nHow does your current routine support (or hinder) your well-being, and what changes would you like to make?\nIf your schedule was suddenly disrupted, what steps could you take to regain a sense of stability?"

    "text": "Some Topic\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nWhy This Matters\nAn individual’s experience with Bipolar Disorder can bring on challenges, such as feelings of uncertainty, loss of control, hopelessness, and intense fluctuations of mood. For those with BD, balancing responsibilities and making decisions can feel like an impossible task. It can feel hard to connect with others and manage both physical and mental health. This kit is designed to give individuals with BD an organized and cohesive list of support and methods to balance the hardships of life in order to overcome the areas that feel out of control.\n\n\nThe Earthquake Metaphor\n\nThe Earthquake Metaphor\nNavigating life as a person with bipolar disorder can feel like living on earthquake-prone land. There can be unexpected disruptions to routine, relationships, and well-being that can feel like a complete disturbance to one’s individual foundation. However, just as earthquake-resistant structures are built with resilience in mind, individuals can develop strategies to cope with and overcome these challenges.\nInspired by the Japanese pagoda, a structure designed to withstand seismic forces, resilience in individuals with bipolar disorder can be supported by a layered system. A strong sense of self-awareness, values, and purpose provides emotional stability during and in-between mood fluctuation episodes. A strong network of friends, family, support services, and mental health resources acts as protective layers, allowing for support during particularly stressful periods. Developing coping mechanisms, such as mindfulness, self-understanding, and seeking support allows individuals with BD to handle stress and mood fluctuations without feeling overwhelmed. Establishing consistent sleep patterns, balanced nutrition, and regular physical activity provides a solid foundation for mental well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrafting Resilience\nResilience is not built overnight—it requires continuous shaping, adaptation, and learning. The symptoms of bipolar disorder can feel overwhelming and out of control, and individuals with BD must learn to navigate their reality by adopting sustainable habits. The Japanese concept of Kaizen, meaning continuous improvement, teaches that small, steady refinements in daily routines, social habits, and coping strategies lead to long-term resilience. Rather than expecting perfection, the philosophy of Wabi-sabi, which embraces imperfection, reminds individuals to see setbacks as natural and valuable parts of learning. Resilience is about recognizing that challenges happen and can be overcame. Moments of struggle do not define the journey but shape it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Master-Apprentice Relationship\nLearning from mentors, peers, and loved ones is crucial in developing resilience. Just as in traditional craftsmanship, where an apprentice learns not only technical skills but also patience and adaptability from a master, people benefit from seeking guidance from experienced individuals. Connecting with others can provide practical advice and emotional support. Supervisors, advisors, coworkers, and colleagues can help individuals navigate career challenges and goals. Joining groups, volunteering, or participating in hobbies fosters a sense of belonging and shared learning, reinforcing the idea that resilience is best developed through community and mentorship. Mentorship creates a ripple effect, empowering both mentor and mentee while enriching the entire community. It’s this collaborative spirit that drives our co-design approach, ensuring the kit reflects real-world challenges and solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreaking Down Complexity\nThe challenges an individual with bipolar disorder faces—mood fluctuations, social responsibilities, and decision-makings—can feel overwhelming. However, planning for these challenges and breaking them down into manageable items can make coping with them less daunting. In craftmanship, intricate designs are completed step by step, with patience and attention to detail. Similarly, approaching challenges brought on by bipolar disorder can help individuals build resilience without feeling overwhelmed.\nSleep hygiene and circadian rhythm regulation play a critical role in maintaining emotional stability. A consistent sleep schedule and nightime routine can help prevent fatigue and mood fluctuations. Nutrition is another key factor. Learning easily accessible recipes, prioritizing whole foods, and minimizing reliance on processed meals can support overall well-being. Social connection is equally important. Engaging in social activities, maintaining contact with family, and seeking support from others can provide stability in challenging times. Finally, managing financial pressures and work obligations requires effective time management, realistic goal-setting, and budgeting strategies to reduce unnecessary stress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTailoring Solutions: Respect for Individuality\nEvery individual’s respective challenges are unique, and each person experiences events differently. This kit is designed to be flexible, allowing individuals to customize their strategies based on their personal strengths, challenges, and values. Just as a master craftsman tailors their approach to the unique qualities of different materials, individuals with bipolar disorder can adapt their strategies to fit their own needs. Creating an individualized work, social, and self-care plan helps individuals take ownership of their well-being. Some people may require additional tailored resources and support, depending on if they’re experiencing a mood episode, additional mental health concern, or outside constraints. Emerging technologies, such as mental health apps and AI-driven tools, can also provide individuals with personalized coping mechanisms that align with their unique needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparedness for Acute Situations\nDuring high-stress periods, such as social conflicts, personal crises, or mood episodes, individuals need pre-prepared coping strategies to minimize stress and overwhelm. The principle of Mottainai, which emphasizes efficiency and resourcefulness, teaches the value of having simple, effective strategies that can be accessed quickly. Techniques such as box breathing, grounding exercises, and structured relaxation can help regulate emotional responses in moments of distress. Keeping a resilience journal, having emergency mental health contacts readily available, and proactively utilizing mental health resources can provide additional layers of security. The ability to anticipate stressors and plan for them in advance allows individuals to maintain stability even in unpredictable situations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding Strength in Repair\nLiving with bipolar disorder can come with a set of unexpected challenges, but growth and transformation come from overcoming obstacles. Inspired by Kintsugi, the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery with gold, we recognize that struggles and setbacks can lead to greater resilience and strength. Rather than hiding difficulties, individuals can embrace them as part of their unique journey, understanding that imperfections and challenges contribute to personal growth. Just as a broken object can be repaired in a way that highlights its history, individuals can learn from adversity and emerge stronger, more self-aware, and more adaptable."

Despite advancements in treatments and technologies, managing BD often requires more than clinical interventions—it demands empathy, lived experience, creativity, and adaptability. These human qualities remain irreplaceable, even in an era of sophisticated AI systems.\nThis is why we are working on the Personalised Recovery and Resilience Kit (PRRK)—a participatory approach inspired by the precision and wisdom of Japanese craftsmanship and the transformative potential of human-AI collaboration.\nBy bringing together the lived experiences of individuals with BD, insights from caregivers and mental health professionals, and the analytical power of AI, we are crafting a framework that empowers people to navigate their unique journeys with greater confidence and support.\n\n\n\nThe Earthquake Metaphor\nLiving with Bipolar Disorder (BD) can feel like navigating a landscape prone to sudden, unpredictable earthquakes. The highs and lows, like tremors and aftershocks, can disrupt daily life and leave individuals and their support networks striving to find stability. How do we prepare for such uncertainty while fostering resilience and recovery?\nThe PRRK draws inspiration from the earthquake-resistant design of Japanese pagodas—structures that have withstood centuries of seismic activity. These pagodas balance flexibility and strength, using principles like interlocking joints and a central pillar to absorb shocks while maintaining stability.\nIn the context of BD, the pagoda becomes a metaphor for resilience: a framework where each “tier” represents a vital aspect of well-being, from physical and emotional health to social support and coping strategies. Human insights, combined with the precision of AI, help co-create tools that align with individual needs—building a system that adapts to life’s challenges, just as the pagoda adapts to the forces of nature.\n\n\n Crafting Resilience\nResilience isn’t built overnight—it’s an ongoing process of learning, adapting, and growing. In Japanese craftsmanship, principles like kaizen (continuous improvement) and wabi-sabi (acceptance of imperfection) provide timeless wisdom that resonates deeply in mental health care.\nKaizen teaches us to embrace incremental, steady progress rather than seeking perfection all at once. In mental health, this might mean celebrating small wins, like sticking to a daily routine or reaching out for support, as these build a foundation for long-term well-being.\nWabi-sabi, on the other hand, reminds us to find beauty in imperfection and impermanence. It’s about accepting that life, recovery, and even our coping strategies won’t always be flawless—and that’s okay. For someone living with Bipolar Disorder, this might look like embracing setbacks as opportunities for growth and learning.\nFor instance, a participant in our project described their recovery journey as a patchwork quilt: each piece imperfect but contributing to a unique, meaningful whole. This quilt, much like resilience itself, is strengthened over time through care and thoughtful effort.\n\n\n The Master-Apprentice Relationship\nIn craftsmanship, the relationship between master and apprentice is a cornerstone of learning and growth. The master imparts not just skills but also values—patience, precision, and dedication. This same principle plays a pivotal role in mental health care and our PRRK project.\nMentorship fosters collaboration and trust between individuals with BD, caregivers, and mental health professionals.

Inspired by craftsmanship, which honours the unique properties of each material, the PRRK tailors its tools to meet the specific needs, strengths, and vulnerabilities of each person.\nGuided by AI, the kit dynamically organises contributions from individuals, caregivers, and professionals into a meaningful, personalised framework. For example, one participant shared how their personalised plan included calming sensory aids for acute distress and journaling prompts to reflect on progress. These tailored strategies helped them feel more in control and supported on their unique journey.\nPersonalisation, powered by human insights and AI, ensures that the PRRK adapts to each individual’s evolving needs. This respect for individuality fosters a sense of ownership and empowerment, leading to better outcomes and greater resilience.\n\n\n\nPreparedness for Acute Situations\nIn moments of acute distress, preparedness is everything. Inspired by the principles of mottainai (efficiency) and waza (mastery through repetition), the PRRK equips individuals with pre-prepared tools designed for quick, effective responses to mental health crises.\nMottainai teaches us to focus on what is essential—using resources purposefully to stabilise a situation without adding unnecessary burden. This translates into simple, efficient interventions like a sensory grounding exercise or a calming mantra that can be quickly accessed when emotions run high.\nMeanwhile, waza emphasises the importance of mastering techniques through repetition so they become second nature. For example, one participant shared how practising paced breathing daily helped them instinctively use it during a moment of extreme anxiety, preventing escalation and restoring a sense of calm.\nThe PRRK incorporates these principles by offering quick-access tools such as breathing exercises, grounding techniques, and sensory aids. These interventions are designed to provide immediate relief while creating space for recovery and reflection.\n\n\n Finding Strength in Repair\nLife’s challenges can leave us feeling broken, but the Japanese art of kintsugi reminds us that repair can lead to something even more beautiful. Kintsugi, or “repair with gold,” involves mending broken pottery with precious metals, highlighting the cracks rather than hiding them. The result? A unique, resilient piece that tells its story through its scars.\nIn mental health and recovery, kintsugi is a powerful metaphor for finding strength in setbacks. The PRRK embraces this philosophy, encouraging individuals to view challenges not as failures but as opportunities for growth and transformation.\nRecovery isn’t about erasing what’s broken—it’s about embracing the imperfections and emerging stronger, more vibrant, and uniquely you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy This Matters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy This Matters\nAn individual’s experience with Bipolar Disorder can bring on challenges, such as feelings of uncertainty, loss of control, hopelessness, and intense fluctuations of mood. For those with BD, balancing responsibilities and making decisions can feel like an impossible task. It can feel hard to connect with others and manage both physical and mental health. This kit is designed to give individuals with BD an organized and cohesive list of support and methods to balance the hardships of life in order to overcome the areas that feel out of control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Earthquake Metaphor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Earthquake Metaphor\nNavigating life as a person with bipolar disorder can feel like living on earthquake-prone land. There can be unexpected disruptions to routine, relationships, and well-being that can feel like a complete disturbance to one’s individual foundation. However, just as earthquake-resistant structures are built with resilience in mind, individuals can develop strategies to cope with and overcome these challenges.\nInspired by the Japanese pagoda, a structure designed to withstand seismic forces, resilience in individuals with bipolar disorder can be supported by a layered system. A strong sense of self-awareness, values, and purpose provides emotional stability during and in-between mood fluctuation episodes. A strong network of friends, family, support services, and mental health resources acts as protective layers, allowing for support during particularly stressful periods. Developing coping mechanisms, such as mindfulness, self-understanding, and seeking support allows individuals with BD to handle stress and mood fluctuations without feeling overwhelmed. Establishing consistent sleep patterns, balanced nutrition, and regular physical activity provides a solid foundation for mental well-being."

    "text": "The Earthquake Metaphor\n\nThe Earthquake Metaphor\nLiving with Bipolar Disorder (BD) can feel like navigating a landscape prone to sudden, unpredictable earthquakes. The highs and lows, like tremors and aftershocks, can disrupt daily life and leave individuals and their support networks striving to find stability. How do we prepare for such uncertainty while fostering resilience and recovery?\nThe PRRK draws inspiration from the earthquake-resistant design of Japanese pagodas—structures that have withstood centuries of seismic activity. These pagodas balance flexibility and strength, using principles like interlocking joints and a central pillar to absorb shocks while maintaining stability.\nIn the context of BD, the pagoda becomes a metaphor for resilience: a framework where each “tier” represents a vital aspect of well-being, from physical and emotional health to social support and coping strategies. Human insights, combined with online resources, help co-create tools that align with individual needs—building a system that adapts to life’s challenges, just as the pagoda adapts to the forces of nature."
