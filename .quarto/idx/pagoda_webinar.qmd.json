This project aligns with implementation science principles, ensuring that the kit is practical, accessible, and potentially scalable across diverse healthcare settings.\n\n# The Metaphor of the Pagoda\n\nThe metaphor of a traditional Japanese pagoda provides a structural and philosophical framework for developing a personalised kit to help individuals with BD.\n\nPagodas are built to withstand earthquakes through a combination of flexibility and strength, specifically using features like the **shinbashira** (a central pillar) and interlocking wooden joints. These architectural elements are designed to [absorb shocks]{.underline} and [maintain stability during crises]{.underline}—an ideal metaphor for the personalised kit that we propose for individuals with BD.\n\n\\[develop separate slides\\] Each part of the pagoda offers inspiration for a different aspect of the kit:\n\n-   **Shinbashira (Core Self-Narratives)**: The central pillar represents an individual’s sense of self (identity, values). For individuals with BD, maintaining a strong personal narrative can serve as an anchor during mood swings. The kit would include exercises like journaling, self-affirmations, and tools to help individuals reconnect with their core identity during mood episodes. \\[Need adaptation to reflect the complexity: see \\@potter2013 and \\@carls-diamante2023 as examples)\n\n-   **Interlocking Joints (Social Support Networks)**: The joints of a pagoda allow flexibility while maintaining the structure's integrity. These joints can be likened to the personal and social networks that help individuals with BD manage their condition. The survival kit would include resources for strengthening relationships, building effective communication strategies, and accessing social support during times of crisis.\n\n-   **Tiers (Coping Strategies)**: The multiple levels of a pagoda represent different coping strategies that work together to ensure resilience. For BD, this could mean incorporating mindfulness exercises, grounding techniques, and emotional regulation practices tailored to various levels of mood disturbance (mild, moderate, severe).\n\n-   **Roof (Protection and Boundaries)**: The roof of the pagoda shields the structure, much like personal boundaries protect emotional well-being. The kit would include tools for setting personal boundaries, managing time effectively, and creating a safe environment that reduces stress and emotional overload.\n\n-   **Foundation (Physical Well-being)**: Just as a pagoda’s base provides stability, the foundation of an individual’s well-being is rooted in their physical health. The kit would include resources on managing sleep, diet, exercise, and medication adherence, all of which are crucial for maintaining mental and emotional balance. \\[eg.

Preparation (Planning the Kit)**\n\nMuch like an earthquake survival kit requires careful planning, the BD kit would be co-designed with the input of individuals living with BD, clinicians, and family members. This collaborative design process will ensure that the resources are relevant, accessible, and tailored to the specific needs of each individual. Workshops will be held to identify the essential personal tools for managing risk behaviours, allowing for a more holistic approach to treatment.\n\n**2. Accessibility (Using the Kit During Episodes)**\n\nIn earthquake-prone areas, survival kits must be easily accessible when disaster strikes. Similarly, for individuals with BD, the survival kit must be easy to access before, during and after mood episodes. This could take the form of a digital toolkit or app that reminds individuals of their coping strategies, core self-narratives, and support networks. Physical reminders, such as notes or cards, could also be included to provide quick access to essential resources during moments of crisis.\n\n**3. Applicability (Implementing the Kit)**\n\nFinally, the kit must be integrated into daily life. This stage focuses on helping individuals implement the tools and resources in the kit regularly, much like practicing emergency drills.

The taxonomy aims to clarify how individuals with BD might perceive the influence of the condition on their personality, behaviour, and self-concept. The taxonomy identifies four possible relationships between BD and the self, emphasizing that these categories are not fixed and can change over time:\n\n1.  BD contributes to the self: In this view, BD is seen as contributing certain traits to an individual’s self-concept. For instance, certain aspects of creativity, energy, or emotional intensity during manic phases may be attributed to BD and are considered part of the person's authentic self.\n\n2.  BD scaffolds the self: Here, BD is thought to shape or scaffold the development of the self. Certain traits or cognitive patterns influenced by BD, such as creativity or ambition, guide the individual's personal development, although other aspects of the self remain independent of BD.\n\n3.  BD gradually becomes part of the self: In this relationship, BD increasingly integrates into an individual’s self-concept over time, especially when symptoms are severe or frequent. Individuals may begin to feel that BD and its associated traits are inseparable from their identity.\n\n4.  BD is not part of the real self: In this case, BD is viewed as something external or separate from the individual’s core identity. The person might view BD as a disorder they manage but not as a fundamental part of who they are.\n\nCarls-Diamante emphasizes that these categories help individuals reflect on how BD affects their self-concept, with the goal of resolving \"self-illness ambiguity\" (SIA)—the confusion about whether certain behaviours or traits stem from the self or the disorder.\n\nde Haan’s Response (2023) @dehaan2023 - \"What Do My Problems Say About Me?”:\n\nde Haan critiques Carls-Diamante's taxonomy, offering an alternative view based on an enactive approach to psychiatry. This approach emphasizes sense-making as a dynamic process shaped by interaction with the world, rather than focusing on static categories of self-concept. de Haan presents key points of divergence from Carls-Diamante’s framework:\n\n1.  Criticism of the Essentialist Approach: de Haan argues that Carls-Diamante’s taxonomy assumes an essentialist view of mental disorders, suggesting that BD is something that can be clearly delineated from the self. de Haan proposes instead that the relationship between self and disorder is more fluid and intertwined, and the focus should be on how individuals make sense of their experiences.\n\n2.  Relational Nature of Self-Knowledge: Contrary to Carls-Diamante's emphasis on self-reflection to resolve SIA, de Haan posits that knowing oneself is not purely an individual task. Instead, it is a relational and practical process that involves engaging with others, such as family members or therapists. Self-knowledge, de Haan argues, is best understood through social interactions and material practices rather than through introspection alone.\n\n3.  Two Types of Self-Illness Ambiguity: de Haan distinguishes between two forms of SIA: experiential SIA (the ambiguity related to interpreting specific experiences, such as \"Is this behavior a result of BD or just me?\") and existential SIA (the broader, long-term question of how to live in accordance with one's values while managing vulnerabilities like BD). She criticizes Carls-Diamante for focusing more on the conceptual side of SIA rather than recognizing these distinctions.\n\n4.  Enactive Approach to Mental Health: de Haan's enactive approach suggests that psychiatric problems arise when one’s patterns of sense-making become rigid and inflexible, and the challenge lies in developing more flexible, adaptive ways of interpreting experiences. She argues that Carls-Diamante’s taxonomy may oversimplify the complexity of how BD affects self-concept by focusing too much on categorization.\n\nKey Differences:\n\n-   Focus on Reflection vs. Interaction: Carls-Diamante emphasizes individual reflection to resolve ambiguity about BD’s role in self-concept, while de Haan insists that self-knowledge is a relational process shaped by interactions with others and cannot be achieved through introspection alone.\n\n-   Approach to Self-Illness Ambiguity: Carls-Diamante’s taxonomy aims to help individuals classify how BD fits into their self-concept. In contrast, de Haan focuses on how sense-making can become rigid, and advocates for a more dynamic, relational process to deal with SIA.\n\n-   Essentialism vs. Enactivism: Carls-Diamante’s model assumes BD can be somewhat isolated as a contributing or scaffolding factor to the self, while de Haan critiques this, proposing that mental disorders and self-concept are deeply intertwined in a complex, enactive system of meaning-making.\n\n# Goals\n\n**Transforming the Narrative:**\n\n\\- Emphasize simple understanding of risk\n\n\\- \\[What risks do people with BD face?\\]\n\n\\- Integrate personal values \\[gist?\\]\n\n\\- Leverage community support groups\n\n\\- Empower individuals to manage behaviours\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Slide 1\n\nFor resources about creating slides in Quarto see: <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>\n\n# Introduction\n\nPeople with Bipolar Disorder (BD) face significant risks of engaging in unpredictable, time-limited, yet devastating behaviours such as substance abuse, hypersexuality, relationship breakdown, and financial recklessness.\n\nThese behaviours often mirror the sudden and powerful impact of natural disasters like earthquakes, leaving individuals and their families dealing with severe consequences, such as legal issues, mental health crises, and strained relationships.\n\n# Problem Statement\n\nDespite their clinical significance, risk-taking behaviours in BD remain under-addressed in current therapeutic models, and existing resources fail to provide individuals with tailored support for managing these behaviours.\n\n**Current Interventions:** - Focus mainly on mood regulation - Gap: Directly addressing risky behaviours @bipolar2020\n\n# Overarching Goal\n\nWe are embarked on developing a **personalised recovery and resilience kit**, co-designed with stakeholders and guided by the metaphor of earthquake-resistant **Japanese pagoda architecture**.\n\nJust as a pagoda withstands earthquakes through its flexible yet strong design, this kit will offer adaptable, layered support to enhance recovery and resilience in individuals with BD.\n\n\\[Edit to create other slides...\\]This project aims to develop and implement a personalised recovery and resilience kit for individuals with BD \\[and their carers\\], offering tailored support to manage serious risk-taking behaviours.
