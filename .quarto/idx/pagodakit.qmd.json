Just like the central pillar supports the building, an individual’s self-awareness and deeply held values can provide stability during manic episodes, preventing total collapse into harmful behaviours.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n\n1.\tWhat are three core values that are most important to you, and how do they guide your decisions?\n2.\tHow has your sense of identity changed or remained the same over the past year?\n3.\tWhat challenges have made you question your values or identity, and how have you responded to them?\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n:::{.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"20%\"}\n\n![](images/pagoda2.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"150\"}\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"80%\"}\n\n**Joint Construction without Nails = Healthy Relationships**\n\nAncient Buildings: The joints in ancient wooden buildings are designed to be flexible, allowing the building to move and sway without snapping or breaking. This flexibility is crucial for absorbing seismic shocks.\n\nHuman Experience: Healthy, flexible relationships that allow for emotional movement and adaptation without rigid expectations can absorb the shocks of mood episodes. Supportive relationships can bend, adjust, and accommodate mood fluctuations without breaking under the strain. These relationships, like family or close friends, provide support while giving space for individual emotional experience.\n:::\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Questions to Consider\n\n1.\tWho are the key people in your life who provide support, and how do they help you during challenging times?\n2.\tHow do you maintain healthy boundaries in relationships while adapting to new social environments?\n3.\tWhat strategies can you use to build new supportive connections while keeping existing relationships strong?\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::{.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"20%\"}\n\n![](images/pagoda3.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"150\"}\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"80%\"}\n\n**Multi-Tiered Roofs = Social Support, Layered Resources and Crisis Prevention**\n\nAncient Buildings: The multi-tiered roofs in pagodas help distribute the forces of an earthquake, acting like shock absorbers that slow down and spread out the shaking.\n\nHuman Experience: Layered social support systems—including family, friends, healthcare professionals, and community resources—act like the multiple layers of a roof. Each layer provides an additional buffer, spreading out emotional shocks and offering safety nets that can slow down the escalation of risky behaviours.

This balance ensures that even during stressful periods, a person isn’t overwhelmed by any single area (e.g., work stress or relationship issues), reducing the risk of extreme reactions during mood episodes.\n:::\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Questions to Consider\n\n1.\tHow do you currently distribute your time between work, social life, self-care, and relaxation?\n2.\tWhat aspects of your routine feel unbalanced, and what small changes could help restore stability?\n3.\tIf stress levels were rising, what would be the first area in your life that you would adjust to maintain balance?\n\n::: \n:::\n\n\n:::{.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"20%\"}\n\n![](images/pagoda5.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"150\"}\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"80%\"}\n\n**Flexible Wooden Structure = Emotional Adaptability and Coping Skills**\n\nAncient Buildings: The flexible wooden structure of Japanese buildings allows them to bend and absorb energy without breaking under stress.\n\nHuman Experience: Emotional adaptability and well-developed coping skills (e.g., mindfulness, emotional regulation techniques, therapy) function in a similar way, allowing a person to \"bend\" with emotional highs and lows without breaking down.
