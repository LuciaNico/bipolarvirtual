Kit Intro Outline:

In life, everyone encounters their own unique set of challenges. It is as if each person is given their own plot of land at birth, where they go through life nurturing their land and working through individual challenges to overcome. For some individuals, their challenges can range from pesky weeds or crop pests, which poses an impactful problem that requires a solution.

Some individuals were given pieces of land that face an entirely different array of difficulties. Instead of their difficulties being associated with what's on the land, their challenge may be navigating the land itself. Their plot of land may be prone to events that are extreme and unpredictable, much like earthquakes. The challenges faced by people with BD are one example of this.

\[Revise\]

People with BD face significant risks of engaging in unpredictable, time-limited, yet devastating behaviours such as substance abuse, hypersexuality, relationship breakdown, self-harm, and financial recklessness, but there are gaps in the types of support provided to individuals with a diagnosis of BD, which focuses primarily on regulating mood. These gaps in support have left other challenges experienced by them, including risk-taking and decision-making, largely unresolved. To address this issue, we are creating a personalised recovery and resilience kit. The development of the kit is informed by findings in past and current studies, and co-design methodology.
