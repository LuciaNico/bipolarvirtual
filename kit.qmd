Kit Intro Outline:

People with Bipolar Disorder (BD) face significant risks of engaging in unpredictable, time-limited, yet devastating behaviours such as substance abuse, hypersexuality, relationship breakdown, and financial recklessness, but there are gaps in the disorder's treatment, which focuses primarily on one aspect: mood regulation.

This has left the other faulty components of the disorder, including risk taking and decision making, largely unresolved. To address this issue, we created a personalised recovery and resilience kit using the metaphor of the Japanese pagoda architecture. The kit is informed by findings in past studies, co-design methodology, and community support groups.

There are five central elements contributing to the kit, based on the structure of the pagoda: the Shinbashira (Core Self-Narratives), Interlocking Joints (Social Support Networks), Tiers (Coping Strategies), Roof (Protection and Boundaries), and the Foundation (Physical Well-being). This kit will go through each element and provide resources to contribute to the maintenance of each one.
